# ARIES Automated Renewals Draft

## Instructions

Please submit any questions as GitHub issues in this repository.

## Background

The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public
Assistance is soliciting proposals from qualified offerors

### How to respond

Within the RFP are specific instructions for how to respond and ask questions. Please take care to read all of the sections prior to posting issues.

We've made every effort to allow for less burden in what we require from interested vendors.  Although the RFP might seem to be pretty extensive, we're asking for limited written responses and believe we'll learn more about your team's approach and offer as part of your verbal presentation.  As discussed in the RFP, we see this presentation to be free flowing vs. formal so that our technical evaluation team can ask questions based on what they've read or heard from your team.
